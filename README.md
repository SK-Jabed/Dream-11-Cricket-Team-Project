# Project Name: Dream 11 Cricket Team

## Project Description
**Welcome to Dream 11 Cricket Team !!!** The 'Dream 11 Cricket' Team webpage is an interactive platform that allows users to create their own fantasy cricket team by selecting players from a pool. It features a smooth user interface with functionalities such as choosing players based on available coins, adding or removing players from the team and clear feedback notifications using React-Toastify. The design also includes a stylish footer and newsletter section, providing a complete and engaging experience for cricket enthusiasts.

## 3 Key Features
1. **Player Selection and Validation:**:
   - Users can choose players for their cricket team while ensuring they stay within a coin budget. The application checks if a player is already selected or if the team has reached the maximum limit and displays alerts using React-Toastify for better notifications.

2. **Dynamic Player Management:**:
   - The app allows users to add or remove players dynamically. Players can be removed from the selected list easily, and users can choose to add more players if they want to modify their team selection.

3. **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:**:
   - The project is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, responsive layout. The integration of DaisyUI components helps maintain a consistent design theme, while React ensures the user interface is interactive and user-friendly.
